Added "rhino-cyberiantiger" engine name so this can be accessed inspite of the jvm's builtin javascript engine.
The classloader that the engine will use for resolving classes is set from Thread.getContextClassLoader() when the ScriptEngine is created.
The engine version is computed at runtime by searching for the MANIFEST.MF supplied by Rhino, and reading the Implementation-Version attribute from the main section.
